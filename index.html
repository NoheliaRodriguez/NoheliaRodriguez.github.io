        <p class="lead mb-4">I was born in Inglewood, California. I went to school most of my life in Hawthorne, California. I attended Ramona Elementary School where I went for six years. My first language is Spanish and I didn't learn English until I was in third grade as part of a program my parents put me in. After that, they started incorporating English slowly. Then I attended Hawthorne Middle School for the next three years. I joined a program that would help me start planning and thinking about college. I learned valuable skills like collaboration, resume building skills, and critical thinking skills. I also started my to volunteer. I would volunteer at the library by organizing and sorting books. I would chart books depending on the reading level and I would act as a tour guide for people interested in the school.<br><br>
        I attended Hawthorne Math and Science Academy from 2019 to 2023. I joined a mentorship program where I became a mentor to freshmen every year. With this program I had to keep in touch with them and ask them how they were doing with classes and asked them how they were doing socially. With this program, I attended extensive training where we learned different ways to be a team leader and take the first steps to connecting with our group members. During the summer, I also helped by volunteering with math tutoring. I would assist the math teacher by proctoring exams, leading group discussions, grading exams, walking around and helping students personally, teaching the whole class. I would be a representative of my school when it was time for enrollment again by explaining to possible students the reason why I chose this school on top of all the others. I would also help by making posters and decorating when it was time to welcome the new freshman. I challenged myself by taking five AP classes that included AP Spanish Language, AP Biology, AP English Literature, AP Environmental Science, and AP Calculus AB. My real passion that led me to choose my major for college was taking an Economics class for a general education requirement. I felt passionate because of how greatly I learned about the economy. <br><br>
        I am currently attending University of California Riverside and pursuing a bachelors degree in Business Economics and plan to minor in Finance and Accounting. On the side, I sometimes babysit my little cousin or work as a server in my aunts catering business. I'm also trying to graduate in three years instead of four and plan to get my masters in Economics right after. I want to study abroad in Europe next summer because it's always been my passion to travel around the world. I am taking 20 units right now and my favorite subject is math. I am a part of the Mexican Folklorico group at UCR because I used to dance for eight years before and it's part of my culture. I am also part of the Latino Business Student Union that teaches you how to network, build a resume, and a job right after.
